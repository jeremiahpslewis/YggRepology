# YggRepology

**Note: This is very much a work in progress**

This repository collects metadata about binaries available via Julia's Yggdrasil.

This metadata can be used to optimize Yggdrasil as well as a source for Repology's binary package index.


TODO:

Special case 100 * x versions...
Autocommit JSON / CSV output
Ensure all requirements covered https://repology.org/docs/requirements
Spot-check for accuracy
Filter out implausible versions (via comparison / dropping * 100 versions)
Debug Openresty, why version info not collected
Fix fetching patch info...
